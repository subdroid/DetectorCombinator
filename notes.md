Number of top neurons: 0,50,100,200,1000 # explot the distribution of activations/expectations to see if the concept of top neurons has a justification in the data
Which top neurons: none, top czech, top english, top multilingual 
Number of zeroed neurons: as observed (this will be equal to the number of top neurons in the monolingual case but lesser in multilingual) 0,50,100,200,1000
